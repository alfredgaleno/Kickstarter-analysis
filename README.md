# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview
This analysis was performed to uncover trends in crowd funding for diferent entertainment productions. Our client Louise is trying to determine the best way to campaign to raise money for the play she is writing. By utilizing the data from Kickstarter we are able to gain a deeper understanding of what goals and timelines worked best for specific genres. Based on our analysis, we are able to confidently say that campaigns that launch in May are the most succesful, and that those who had fundraising goals of $4,999 or les are also more likely to succeed when compared to the otehr campaigns on Kickstarter.

## Analysis
In order to provide Louise the best information we looked at two specific relationships. 1) How well theater campaigns did based on launch date, and 2) how the fundraising goal of that campaign correleated to it's success. These two metrics helped gave us actionable information that could inform Louise's decisions

### Systematic Approach
In order to see when the best launch date would be we utilize a pivot table to see if there were any trends correleating success and launch date. Based on the information collected it was evident that campaigns launched in May had the highest success rates. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate this trend.

When looking at success in relation to fundrasiing goals we had to create a table that captured how many plays were successful, failed, and canceled for each fundraising range. Based on this data we were able to derive that the most successful plays were ones that had fundraising goals of $4,999 or less. This relationship is illustrated below in Fig.3. While the plays with goals from $35,000-$44,999 also had good success rates, there were exponetially more plays that were in the lower fundraising goal (<$4,999).

### Challenges
There were no major challenges when completing this analysis. The most important part was to ensure that the data added value to the questions we were asking. By focusing on specific categories of campaigns we were able to derive more applicable information for Louise. In turn this information should help her when launching her play. 

## Conclusions
As seen in the data we analyzed, if Louise wants to have the best odds of succeeding she should launch her play in May because after that her chances of succeeding will diminish every month after. In addition, when campaigning she should have a goal of less than $4,999. By limiting the data we looked at to only plays (which Louise was making) it gave us more information than the raw data did initially. Further work could be cenetered around what the best medium for Louises work could be. This could be accomplished by comparing all the different generes with their corresponding success rates. Even though she enjoys theater it might make sense to look at TV or Film in order to gain more exposure for her work. With these insights Louise will be more capable of planning her play and making it a hit!
